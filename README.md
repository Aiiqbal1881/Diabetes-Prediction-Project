Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning  

# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes using machine learning techniques. It utilizes **Python**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and various data preprocessing techniques to build a reliable classification model.  

# Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:** Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Libraries:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Matplotlib (for visualization)  
  - Seaborn (for better visualization)  

# ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical records of patients with diagnostic attributes. It includes features such as:  
- Pregnancies  
- Glucose Level  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI (Body Mass Index)  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age  

# ðŸ“Š Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Normalization and scaling  
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Implementing **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Checking accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
   - Visualizing confusion matrix  

# How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```  
2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the main script:  
   ```bash
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```  

# ðŸ“ˆ Results  
- The model provides a classification report with key metrics.  
- Visualizations such as correlation heatmaps and feature importance are included.  

# Future Improvements  
- Experiment with other ML algorithms like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**  
- Implement **Deep Learning** models for better accuracy  
- Deploy as a **web application using Flask or Streamlit**
